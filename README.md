## Project Summary

Create a page that allows users to select a destination from a form. Selectable destinations are filtered from a list of categories based on the season chosen by the user. Once selected, the destination is displayed below the form.

## Solution Assets

The assets provided to build the solution are located in solution > assets. They include:
* `kayak-logo.svg` - logo from design
* `search-icon.svg` - icon for submit button
* `forza-black.woff2` - web font from design
* `tour-data.json` - data for the application
* `{city}-{id}.jpg` - destination images formatted based on corresponding values in the JSON

## Design Specifications

All of the design specifications are included in design > index.html.

Opening this file will show you a tool used for gathering layout specifications for a design. Clicking on various elements within the design will expose size, color, and spacing information for each element. This design may include different destination data from the included JSON file.

Design Guidelines:
* On page load (and before selection), the form fields should contain placeholders (season, category, destination).
* While the form `<select>` element should be styled, you may use the native browser styles for dropdown menu containing the `<option>` elements (shown on click).
* If in doubt, choose the path that leads towards clean design and good UX

## Data & Logic Requirements

Form Fields:
* Season - spring, summer, autumn, winter
* Category - only include categories valid for the season
* Destination - only include destinations valid for the selected category

Logic Guidelines:
* Any form field that cannot yet be toggled should be disabled. For example, we may want to disable the destination field prior to the user's selection of a category.
* If a field is changed out-of-order, page elements should be updated accordingly. For example, if user changes the category after selecting a destination, some form inputs should be cleared. 
* Changing the destination and submitting the form should update the destination image and title. If no destination is specified, the image and title area can be hidden.

## Evaluation Criteria 

* Meets the design specifications
* Meets the data & logic requirements
* Simple (lightweight) and uses native HTML, CSS and JS where possible
* Code follows best practices for style, organization and performance
* Compatible with modern browsers (recent versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari)
* Produces a clean & smooth user experience
